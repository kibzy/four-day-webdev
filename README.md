# four-day-webdev
This is just a repo of web dev projects that are built in 4 days by a beginner web dev. 
They will vary in quality depending on whats going on in life outside this

## Rules
- They are only going to use html-css-vanillajs
- They are each in their own folder
- After four days the project is abandoned wherever it has reached and forgotten. However, pieces of that project can be roles into a new repo
- Each folder will have a scope, if work is completed before the four days is up, the scope can be expanded or a new project can start early
- The focus is on getting things working and learning. there will be lots of ugliness and mistakes. Those are all enouraged
- Any rule can be broken.....
